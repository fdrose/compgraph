# Compgraph

The implementation of the computational graph using a Map-Reduce model.

## Getting Started

The library include the following algorithms (`algorithms.py`):
1. Algorithm for calculating tf-idf
2. Algorithm for calculating pmi
3. Algorithm for finding the average speed in the roads, depending on weekday and hour

All the Map, Reduce and Join operations which are used in the algorithms can be found in the `operations.py` file. 
The Graph class can be found in the `graph.py`.

### Installing

You should install the library with the following command:

    pip install -e compgraph

You can also install additional packages for the visualisation script:

    pip install -e compgraph[visualisation]

## Running the tests

To run test you can use the following command:

    pytest compgraph

### Tests

There are a different blocks of tests. It can be found in the 'tests' folder, 
which include:
   * correctness tests (`tests/correctness/`)
   * memory tests (`tests/memory/`)
   * additional operations tests (`tests/test_operations.py`)
   * graph methods tests and algorithms multiple run tests (`tests/test_graph.py`)
   * tests for cli (`tests/test_examples.py`)

### Scripts

You can also run a script for any algorithm, to do that use the following commands for a given algorithm:
```python
# word count algorithm
python compgraph/examples/run_word_count.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
```

```python
# inverted index algoritm
python compgraph/examples/run_inverted_index.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
```

```python
# pmi algorithm
python compgraph/examples/run_pmi.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
```

```python
# maps algorithm
python compgraph/examples/run_yandex_maps.py <input_times_file_path> <input_length_file_path> <output_file_path>
```
You can also visualise the result of the yandex maps algorithm with the following command (it will save the plot into your current direction):
```python
# maps algorithm visualiser
python compgraph/examples/avg_speed_visualiser.py <input_file_path>
```
